# ofxGoIO

[openFrameworks](openframeworks.cc/) addon for interfacing with [Vernier Go! USB](https://www.vernier.com/) products using [Vernier's GoIO sdk.](https://github.com/VernierST/GoIO_SDK)


## NOT READY YET. DONT USE!!

## Platforms

Currently, this addon provides the Macos and Windows compatibility and the compiled SDK for these. Linux is supported by the SDK although I have not compiled it. Once having the sdk compiled for linux, most probably, it will work without modifying the addon.

## Compatibility
This addon was developed using openFrameworks version 0.11.1. There might be backwards compatibility although I will not test nor give support for it.
